# ConceptualClassics

Kaggle is a treasure trove of knowledge. There is a lot of valuable information being present in Kaggle notebooks / forum posts and so on.

On the other hand, beginners find it hard to spot the right notebooks / posts to learn the concepts so as to apply them in Kaggle and real life problems.

This series of Getting Started posts on Conceptual Classics will help uncover the classical Kaggle notebooks on various DS / ML concepts, so that the learning process becomes easy for the beginners.

This repo has links to all the Kaggle posts.

Happy Kaggling!!
